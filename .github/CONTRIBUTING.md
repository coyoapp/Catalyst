# Contributing to the Catalyst

First off, thank you for helping us build a better UI experience! To keep our library high-quality, please follow these guidelines.

---

## 1. How to Report a Bug
* Check if the issue already exists in the "Issues" tab.
* Use our **Bug Report** template.
* **Crucial:** Include screenshots or screen recordings of the UI glitch on both iOS and Android if possible.

## 2. How to Propose a Feature
* Open an issue using the **Feature Request** template.
* Explain the "Why"—what design problem are we solving?

## 3. Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `feat/component-name` or `fix/issue-description`.
3. **Commit Messages:** We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Examples: `feat(button): add loading state`, `fix(colors): update primary-500 hex`
   - *Note: This is required for our automated CHANGELOG.*

## 4. UI & Visual Testing
Before submitting a PR, ensure:
* The component looks correct in **Demo Applications**.
* You have tested on a small screen (e.g., iPhone SE) and a large tablet.

## 5. Review Process
* All PRs require approval from the **@coyoapp/mobile-design-core** team.
* Your branch must be up-to-date with `main` before merging.
