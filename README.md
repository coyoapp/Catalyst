# Catalyst Mobile Design System

Catalyst, design system, is single source of truth for native iOS and Android. It contains the platform-agnostic design tokens and the automated pipelines that generate and publish native libraries.

## 📦 Project Structure
This monorepo contains all components of the mobile design system pipeline:

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `/tokens`   | Source of Truth. Platform-agnostic design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) defined in JSON | 
| `/android`  | The native Android Catalyst Libray and a demo app (app)                                        |
| `/iOS`      | The native Swift package Catalyst Libray and a demo app (iOSDemo)                              |
| `/.github`  | CI/CD workflows for token generation and package publishing.                                   |

## 🚀 Getting Started (Consuming the Libraries)
{Insert Setup steps here}
### iOS:
PS: After adding the dependency or to receive any update in Design System Library `tuist fetch` has to be executed.

## 🏗️ Development Workflow (Contributing)

This repository uses Style Dictionary to automatically generate native Swift and Kotlin code from the JSON tokens in the `/tokens` directory.

Workflow as a contributor:
* Make all desired changes to the JSON files inside `/tokens/src` (Keep the structure of JSONs).
* Do not manually edit any of the generated code in the `/android/catalyst/.../tokens/generated` or `/iOS/Catalyst/Sources/Catalyst/Tokens/Generated` directories. These files will be regenerated by the workflow that will override any change.
* Commit your changes and create a pull request.
* Once your pull request is merged, the `Tokens` workflow will automatically run, build the new native code from your tokens, and commit the changes back to the main branch.

To test changes locally, demo applications can be used.

## 🏷️ Publishing a New Version

Publishing new versions of both packages is an automated process triggered by pushing a new Git tag.
* Ensure your main branch is up-to-date with all changes.
* Pull the latest main branch to your local machine.
* Create and push a new, versioned tag. We use semantic versioning (e.g., vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
